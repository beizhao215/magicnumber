Insight Data Engineering Fellow Project

The motivation of the project is to explore spending patterns within a social network. A data pipeline was built to support both batch processing and streaming processing. Dashboard was created to show the users with the most valuable social network, and their real time activities. The analaysis is based on NYC taxi data and facebook social network data. 

The cluster for data pipeline and web server was hosted on AWS but currently the ec2 instances have been terminated.
